# Subcellular location predictor model trained in R

## In this project: I attempt to build a workflow in R that filters and cleans raw data on proteins. Using global features such as mass, length, dipeptide and peptide composition, and hydrophobicity, and model is trained to predict the subcellular location of the protein.
